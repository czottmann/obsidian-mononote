# Mononote

This plugin ensures each note occupies only one tab. If a note is already open, its existing tab will be focussed instead of opening the same file in the current tab.

That's it.


## Installation

1. Search for "Mononote" in Obsidian's community plugins browser. ([This link should bring it up.](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=zottmann))
2. Install it.
3. Enable the plugin in your Obsidian settings under "Community plugins".

That's it.
