# Release history

## 1.2.0, 2024-06-TODO

I've rewritten the entire internal logic of Mononote to be more robust and reliable. This should fix a lot of the issues that have been reported, and make the plugin more stable overall. It's been a journey.

### Fixes

- If a tab (T1) loads a note (N1), and N1 is already shown in another tab (T2), T1 will go back to its previous file, and focus T2. If there is no history for T1, it will close. [#18]
- Cmd/Ctrl-clicking a note in the File Explorer no longer endlessly flashes the tab [#21]
- Clicking a link in a pinned tab no longer loads the note in that pinned tab, as you would expect.


## 1.1.1, 2024-01-09

For Mononote to work correctly, _Settings_ â†’ _Editor_ â†’ **_Always focus new tabs_ MUST BE ENABLED**. This is because it hooks into the `active-leaf-change` event which is not fired for new files when this setting is disabled. Technical limitations, sorry.

### New

- Tab handling has been entirely reworked to be more robust and reliable.
- The plugin now respects pane & window boundaries as it should, superfluous tabs will only be closed in the active pane or window. 
- If Mononote encounters a duplicate, it'll now favor the existing tab, and close the new one. This prevents losing undo history.
- Adds workaround for files which don't trigger Obsidian's `file-open` event, meaning Mononote will now work with files which aren't notes, such as PDFs or images. See the README for information on the updated behavior, and what to expect. [#2]
- Adds support for anchor links: If note A is already open in a tab 1, and you attempt to open note A in a tab 2, but with an anchor link (reference to a headline or block), tab 2 will be closed, while tab 1 will focus the anchor link. [#3]

### Fixes

- Mononote no longer gets confused when previewing a link while the Hover Edit plugin is active. [#7]
- If a pinned file is opened again (while active), it will no longer open a duplicate tab. [#1]
- Mononote will no longer close pinned tabs. Thanks to @d9k for the PR! [#4]
